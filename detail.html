                The NDSM neighborhood is a lively area. You will find countless murals here, as well as artists' homes
                and
                studios. The NDSM wharf has been a huge photogenic hotspot for a number of years, the number of bars and
                restaurants is still growing. The site is more than ten football fields in size, and therefore offers
                plenty
                of space for many activities for young and old.

                <img src="mural.png" alt="street art op bakstenen muur">
                <p>
                    NDSM is one of the best places for graffiti and street art in the city. The STREET Museum is a great
                    place
                    to start if you want to experience urban art. More than 150 works can be admired here, some of which
                    are
                    huge and reach the ceiling.

                one

                tulips in Amsterdam, NDSM is a great place to be.

            <h2>Flea market IJ-hallen</h2>
            <p>
                The NDSM neighborhood is a mecca for lovers of vintage and antique goods. You can spend hours wandering
                the
                IJ-Hallen flea market hunting for vintage treasures. IJ-hallen is the largest flea market in Europe. Due
                to
                the size of the market, the chances of success are very high. Unique products are offered at very low
                prices. Hundreds of stalls offer everything from clothing and jewelry to kitchen supplies and home
                furnishings. It's a great place to look for second-hand, upcycled items.

                different
                music genres and celebrations. For those who like a bit of funk, for example, the Wicked Jazz Sounds

                The NDSM Food Festival in August is a must for culinary delights. Enjoy snacks and drinks as the city's
